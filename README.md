# Welcome to the EncryptAll repository!
 This is called `EncryptAll` because, well, what we have going on here    
 is an application that is mostly just a demo of different encryption   
 implementations. As time goes on, more will probably be added. Even the    
 experimental protocols are on the table, the UI is simple as it is there    
 to show them off. And you see, while it is a catchy name, I plan to add    
 quite a few. Maybe even, all of them...?

## Introduction
 Okay first and foremost, do not use this for important tasks. Play with it,    
 add your own encryption options, whatever works for you, but I am not here    
 designing something meant to be used to encode secret messages to your crush    
 or anything like that. Because if he/she is even a slightly competent programmer,    
 you are likely going to be embarrased when they break the code and your heart at   
 the same exact time. 
 
## Update October/2023
I am a few days late on this update for `EncryptAll`. I have made more progress but a bit   
of it got lost in the sauce (and by sauce I mean something stupid that I did), and so far,  
yeah I mean there has not been an update. But since I am just doing this on the side for   
fun its just like whatever.    
   
Nothing has changed by much except for the development of a module around BaseXYZ conversions  
that would be the first module, and most importantly a UI menu for parameters needs to be made   
in order for me to even think about adding some actual modules. Probably starting with something   
like DES, so symmetric key encryptions would be the first module.   
   
I do not do UI like that though, I can put it down sure, but I dont have the capacity to design it,   
at least it wont be any good by the time I even do. I am not one of those delusional programmers that  
says "design work? pffft how hard could it be?"... Technically, it can be very hard, and we all know   
the super high standards these people bring to this task that they do not know how to do (obviously).  
No disrespect meant, some people really do take it serious and become well versed in design. 

That's what I would feel compelled to do, which takes time, which I don't have for this project like that,   
so it is what it is. Maybe I build the modules and link the repo **[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never_Gonna_Give_You_Up)**. Other than that I apologize to    
all zero people who are watching and following this. In fact, this update is not for anyone obviously.   
Unless you are another user who found yourself here, and honestly if you are still reading this I promise    
you can see the fact that this project is ___'ight___ at best. There is no need to really dig too deep    
into this one. In fact I don't post my best code on github anyways unless it's made for others to use,   
not that I am some kind of super awesome programmer, I strive to be, but there is room to put in more work.

Anyways nice update, gold start, see ya next month.

## Conclusion
 That's right, conclusion. I have nothing else to say. The app is not even built yet.
