# Welcome to the EncryptAll repository!
 This is called "EncryptAll" because, well, what we have going on here <br/>
 is an application that is mostly just a demo of different encryption <br/>
 implementations. As time goes on, more will probably be added. Even the <br/>
 experimental protocols are on the table, the UI is simple as it is there <br/>
 to show them off. And you see, while it is a catchy name, I plan to add <br/>
 quite a few. Maybe even, all of them...?

## Introduction
 Okay first and foremost, do not use this for important tasks. Play with it, <br/>
 add your own encryption options, whatever works for you, but I am not here <br/>
 designing something meant to be used to encode secret messages to your crush <br/>
 or anything like that. Because if he/she is even a slightly competent programmer, <br/>
 you are likely going to be embarrased when they break the code and your heart at <br/>
 the same exact time. 

## Conclusion
 That's right, conclusion. I have nothing else to say. The app is not even built yet. <br/>
